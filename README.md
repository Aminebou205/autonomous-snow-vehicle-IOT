- Detect slip and directional drift
- Visualize mobility performance
- Deploy results on AWS EC2

# Repository Structure
- data      : Raw and processed datasets
- notebooks   : Data analysis and modeling notebooks
- dashboards  : Streamlit dashboard
- models      : Saved models
- docs       : Project report and documentation
